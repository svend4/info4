## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Skill Not Recognized

**Solution:**
```
1. Verify file location
   - SKILL.md must be in skill directory
   - Directory name matters: chat-migration-*-v*

2. Check file format
   - Must be Markdown (.md)
   - YAML header required (---)
   - No syntax errors

3. Reinstall
   - Remove skill
   - Restart Claude
   - Reinstall fresh
```

### Issue: Features Not Working

**v3.6 specific:**
```
Problem: Navigation not showing
→ Check: Ask explicitly "show navigation"
→ Fix: Include NAVIGATION.md template

Problem: Priorities unclear
→ Check: Look for 🔴🟡🟢⚪ markers
→ Fix: Ask "organize by priority"
```

**v4.5 specific:**
```
Problem: Quantum features slow
→ Check: Hardware (CPU only?)
→ Fix: Consider GPU/cloud

Problem: AI models missing
→ Check: Download size (5GB)
→ Fix: Ensure space + download

Problem: Pre-AGI not working
